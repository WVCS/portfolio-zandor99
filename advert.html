	<center><p><p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #2b0057;">My album design was influeced by the style of Victor Moscosso because I  used his style of having two different colors in a swirling pattern surrounding a person or object at the center of the work. Additionally, the object at the center is usually comprised in an alternating pattern of the two colors that are used in the rest of the piece, this was primarily used in the t-shirt design, but was also used to a lesser degree in the billboard design, with the boxed text being comprised of the same colors as the swirling pattern.<br><br>

The shirt design was mainly inspired by the original album cover design that I used, combining elements from both the front and the back side of the album for the back of the shirt, and using an older design that I decided not to use for the album on the front of the shirt.<br><br>

The billboard was meant to resemble the back cover of my album, with the boxed text and use of victor moscoso's signature font style inside the box. Additionally, the color of the text in the box is meant to contrast with the rest of the box's colors and to continue the pattern of the rest of the billboard.<br><br>

The plane image mainly uses elements from the back album cover, with the clowns poking their heads out on different sides of the plane; however, the pattern is altered slightly, since a swirling pattern would not have looked as good on the plane as it did in the other examples.
