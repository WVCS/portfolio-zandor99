<center><p><p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #2b0057;"> Front Cover: On the front cover of the album, I have a clown wearing a chain with the acronym for the band (PSCP), and also a bishop's hat to show that this band is devoted primarily to Christian rap. The clown was inspired by the clown that often appears on the cover of albums from the band "Insane Clown Posse."<br>

Back Cover: Here, I have positioned the album's songs in the center of the album, and a member of the band poking his head up from the bottom of the album, staring menacingly at the person who has purchased the album.<br>

Record Label: Here, I have mostly just used the album cover and back album cover, but resized them to fit onto the smaller area.</p></center>
